# Restaurant Reservation System
This repository contains the code for a full-stack restaurant reservation system, built using modern web technologies.

## Features
### Table Reservation: 
Users can reserve tables for a specific date and time, providing their name, email, phone number, and the number of guests. The system checks for availability and prevents double-booking.
### Data Caching:
Backend uses Redis as a cache to improve data fetching times
## Technologies
### Frontend: 
The frontend of the application is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generates static websites for React based web applications.

### Backend: 
The backend is an Express.js server, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.

### Database: 
The system uses Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative, for database operations. It provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with the database.

This project demonstrates a good understanding of these technologies, as well as concepts like asynchronous programming, API design, and database management.
